*Dynamic Connectivity*

Steps of developing alg

Model the prob
FInd the alg
fast enough? fits in memory?
if not fig out why?
find a way to address the problem?
iterate until satisfied?

Dynamic connectivity
gn set of n objects
union cmd: connect two objects
find/connected query: is there a path?

union( ,)   
connected ( ,)  T/F  Check  the connection

*Quick FInd* [eager algorithm]

p and q are connected only if they have same id
union = change the id[p] to id[q]

It takes Quadratic time. too slow

*Quick Union* [Lazy approach]
